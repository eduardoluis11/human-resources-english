I translated the text from the comments in the documentation from Spanish to English in part with artificial 
intelligence called GPT-3, OpenAI’s large-scale language-generation model. Upon generating draft language, I reviewed, 
edited, and revised the language to my liking, and I take ultimate responsibility for the content of my code and 
documentation. I did not use an app to generate this translation. I copied the text from GPT 3's Playground, pasted it 
on a text editor, and then edited it.
